##Purpose
* There is no source code for the skill interface.  There are only files that describe the configuration for the Alexa skill interface.  The skill interface describes the various intents that users can have to trigger Skill Service actions.  The Skill Service functions will then call the normal AWS Lambda function and reuse the existing code/logic.  

* This code cannot gather matrics for usage of the Alexa skill.  

##Language

The configuration files are generally JSON formatted files.  Other wise, it is plain-text that is copied and pasted into the [Alexa developers portal](https://developer.amazon.com/home.html).  Ex. Slot Types


##Global availability
* This skill will have on US AWS Lambda functions.  European availability will be planned at a later time..

##Alexa Card Images
* Images have not been added at this time, but will be added in the future.
